I'm Stephanie Wenxin Liu. I am a computer scientist, software engineer and site reliability engineer with a decade of industry experience, based in London. 

Recently I've been working on research at the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning. Specifically, applying neural networks to bounding volumes and spatial queries, shifting construction from a problem in computational geometry to a problem of optimisation. Our latest article, [Neural Bounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06822), is published at [SIGGRAPH 2024](https://s2024.siggraph.org/).

You can get in touch with me at wenxin.liu.cs[at]gmail.com.
